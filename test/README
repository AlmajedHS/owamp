This directory holds owamp unit tests:

owtvec:  This application uses the AES based Exponential
         Deviates functions from the owamp library and
         verifies the implementation successfully produces
         the expected results from Appendix B of the OWAMP
         specification.

owstats: read a reference session message and verify it can
         be parsed and statistics can be generated

owping1: use the client protocol api to generate and send messages
         to a simiulated server, which validates them and then
         returns appropriate responses

owe2e:   launch owping/owampd child processes and capture
         the test output - verify there were no errors
