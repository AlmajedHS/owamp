1. (Server) Develop as part of inetd server and standalone server
        A. Standalone
                not all systems run inetd
                easier to debug
        B. inetd subsystem
                simple to do
                easy to deploy - perhaps become standard part of inetd
                not many req's - why use the resources

2. Send/Recieve roles should be separate processes from client/server
        A. select of single file descriptor - perhaps more accurate time
        B. localize clock mgmt to send/recv code/process

3. Concurrent server model
        inetd model - don't need to worry about it
                breaks need to be applied via inetd rules
        stand alone:
                use preforked model (pthreads not portable)
                traditional accept/fork/exec not responsive enough
		breaks applied using controlling parent process
