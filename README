	owamp

owamp [One Way Active Measurement Protocol] is a sample implementation of
draft-ietf-ippm-owdp-05.txt(name to change).

It is organized as follows:

config/		holds autoconf junk.
I2util/		convienient utility functions... Error reporting, hash funcs...
owamp/		directory for owamp api - a high level abstraction for
		speaking the owamp protocol.
owampd/		An owamp server implementation.
owping/		A command line owamp client (one way ping).
owdigest/	A program to create digests of delay data from full session
		files.

powstream/	A client-daemon for continuous one-way tests. (not installed)
scripts/	Support scripts - (not installed). (There are the beginnings
		of example init.d scripts to start up owampd here...)

	The powstream application is a one-off application that Internet2
is using to run continuous tests on a mesh of Abilene measuremetn nodes.
There are support scripts for this measurement "mesh" application in the
scripts directory.
