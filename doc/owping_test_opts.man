.SS Test Configuration Options:
.TP
\fB\-c\fR \fIcount\fR
.br
Number of test packets to send in the test session.
.RS
.IP Default:
100
.RE
.TP
\fB\-D\fR \fIDSCP\fR
.br
Set an RFC 2474 style DSCP value for the TOS byte in the sending packets. This
option may only be specified once and is mutually exclusive with the
\fI\-H\fR option.
.RS
.IP Default:
Unset.
.RE
.TP
\fB\-f\fR | \fB\-F\fR \fIfromfile\fR
.br
Perform a One-way test \fBf\fRrom the target \fItestpeer\fR. The \fI\-F\fR
form is used to save the results in \fIfromfile\fR. If no directional
options (\fI\-f, \-F, \-t, \-T\fR) are specified, \fBowping\fR requests
concurrent bidirectional tests, otherwise only the explicit directions are
performed.
.RS
.IP Default:
True, unless the \fI\-t\fR or \fI\-T\fR have been specified explicitly.
.RE
.TP
\fB\-H\fR \fIPHB\fR
.br
Set an RFC 2836 style Per Hop Behavior identification code for the TOS
byte in the sending packets. This option may only be specified once and is
mutually exclusive with the \fI\-D\fR option.
.TP
\fB\-i\fR \fIsend_schedule\fR
.br
.I send_schedule
indicates the scheduled delay between sent packets. This is done by
specifying a list of \fIdelays\fR in a comma separated string (spaces are
not allowed). Each \fIdelay\fR
is indicated by a \fIvalue\fR and a \fItype\fR. There are two currently
available types of \fIdelays\fR that can be specified:
.RS
.IP \fBf\fR
[\fBf\fR]ixed offsets. This is used to indicate that the \fIvalue\fR is
a real offset.
.IP \fBe\fR
[\fBe\fR]xponential. This is used to indicate an exponentially distributed
pseudo-random quantity with a mean about the \fIvalue\fR given. (This
is the default if no alpha qualifier is specified. The intent of this is
to negate periodicity effects.)
.PP
When the sending process starts, it looks at the first \fIdelay\fR in the
list and waits that long to send the first packet. It takes the next
\fIdelay\fR from the list to determine how much longer to wait before sending
the second packet. This process continues
until there are no more \fIdelay\fR values specified in the list. At this
point the sending process loops back to the beginning of the complete
\fIsend_schedule\fR and this process begins again. This continues until
the sending process has sent \fIcount\fR packets as specified by the
\fB\-c\fR option.
.IP Default:
0.1e (seconds)
.RE
.TP
\fB\-E\fR \fIenddelay\fR
.br
Amount of time for a sender to wait after session completion (last packet
send-time plus \fItimeout\fR) before sending the stop sessions message.

This is important if the sender clock is running ahead of the receiver clock.

A session is complete \fItimeout\fR after the send time of the final packet.
If the sender clock is ahead of the receivers clock, the sender will declare
the session complete before the receiver. The receiver
is only allowed to retain records for the packets that were sent at least
\fItimeout\fR before it receives the stop sessions message from
the sender. Therefore, if the sender clock is running ahead of the receiver
clock, the receiver will be forced to delete some number of the final
packets from the session.

This parameter directs the sender to wait \fIenddelay\fR after
session completion allowing the receiver clock to be essentially \fIenddelay\fR
later than the sender clock and still retain full sessions.
.RS
.IP Default:
1.0 (seconds)
.RE
.TP
\fB\-L\fR \fItimeout\fR
.br
Amount of time to wait for a packet to be received before declaring it
lost. As such, it is also the amount of time the test session has to
stay active after the last packet is sent to be able to count duplicate
packets. I.e., add this number to the duration of your session to determine
how long to expect a test session to take.

Note: The default of 2 seconds longer than a round-trip estimate was simply
a guess for how long a typical user would be willing to wait after the end
of the test for the results. For the \fBOWAMP\fR results to be
statistically relevant and to be able to compare data between two sessions
the \fItimeout\fR option should be specified.
.RS
.IP Default:
2 seconds longer than the round-trip estimate. (seconds)
.RE
.TP
.BI \-P " 0 | lowport-highport"
.br
Specify the specific port range to use on the local host for
.I OWAMP-Test
packets. This can be specified in two ways. First, as 0 which would indicate
.B owping
should allow the system to pick the port (ephemeral). Second, as a range.
.I lowport
must be a smaller value than
.I highport
and both numbers must be valid port values. (16 bit unsigned integer values)
.RS
.IP Default:
0
.RE
.TP
\fB\-s\fR \fIsize\fR
.br
Size of the padding to add to each minimally-sized test packet. The minimal
size for a test packet in \fIopen\fR mode is 14 bytes. The minimal size
for a test packet in \fIauthenticated\fR or \fIencrypted\fR mode is 32 bytes.
.RS
.IP Default:
0 (bytes)
.RE
.TP
\fB\-t\fR | \fB\-T\fR \fItofile\fR
.br
Perform a one-way test \fBt\fRoward the target \fItestpeer\fR. The \fI\-T\fR
form is used to save the results in \fItofile\fR. If no directional
options (\fI\-f, \-F, \-t, \-T\fR) are specified, \fBowping\fR requests
concurrent bidirectional tests, otherwise only the explicit directions are
performed.
.RS
.IP Default:
True, unless the \fI\-f\fR or \fI\-F\fR have been specified explicitly.
.RE
.TP
\fB\-z\fR \fIdelayStart\fR
.br
Time to wait before starting a test. \fBowping\fR attempts to calculate a
reasonable minimum delay to ensure that the start of the test happens
after completion of the setup protocol. If \fIdelayStart\fR is specified
as a value less than this reasonable minimum delay, the reasonable minimum
will be used instead.
.RS
.IP Default:
2-3 times the round-trip estimate plus 1 (seconds)
